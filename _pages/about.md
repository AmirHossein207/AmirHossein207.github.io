I am currently working as senior data scientist at DNAmito, a startup company that is transofrming cancer care and treatment using AI and Decision Support Systems.  I also have a part-time affiliation with the department of precision medicine at Maastricht University. I serve as consulatant to a few startups as well.

My background is in applied mathematics. I specialized in systems biology modeling during my PhD. Later I did research on machine learning applications in genomics.
